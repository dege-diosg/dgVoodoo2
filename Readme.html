2. Features
</u></font></h2>
<p>
dgVoodoo 2 is a set of old graphics API's implemented for Windows Vista/7/8/10.
<br><br>
They are implemented on Direct3D 11/12 and they can use different device types as wrapping output:
<ul>
    <li>Hardware rendering at GPU feature level 12.0 (recommended but currently has some issues)</li>
    <li>Hardware rendering at GPU feature level 11.0 (recommended)</li>
    <li>Hardware rendering at GPU feature level 10.1 (has a minor limitation for DX8/9)</li>
    <li>Hardware rendering at GPU feature level 10.0 (there are some limitations)</li>
    <li>Software rendering through Microsoft WARP renderer</li>
</ul>

The following graphics API libraries are implemented:
<ul>
    <li>Glide 2.11, Glide 2.45, Glide 3.1 and Glide 3.1 Napalm</li>
    <li>DirectX 1-7 (all versions of DirectDraw and Direct3D up to version 7)</li>
    <li>Direct3D 8.1</li>
    <li>Direct3D 9</li>
</ul>
<p>
For both Glide and DirectX, dgVoodoo pushes as many emulation work to the GPU as
possbile. Thus, the entire internal 3Dfx GPU logic is mapped to pixel shaders
for Glide emulation, and all the fixed function vertex & pixel processing
pipeline is implemented by shaders for DirectX emulation (when possible).<br>
Glide libraries basically can work in two ways:
<ul>
    <li>Using their precompiled shaders - it is the less efficient mode (legacy)</li>
    <li>Using an external HLSL shader compiler - this is the most efficient and recommended mode and referred as 'dynamic shader compiling'</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If dynamic shader compiling is available (see Usage) then dgVoodoo can work
with specialized shaders requiring much less GPU power, providing much better
performance, especially on weaker video cards.<br>
</p>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
3. Requirements
</u></font></h2>
<ul>
<li>Operating system:       Windows Vista/7/8/10</li>
<li>Hardware:               GPU supporting DirectX feature level 10.0.</li>
</ul>
Optional and recommended:
<ul>
    <li>GPU supporting DirectX <font color = "#FFFFFF">feature level 11.0 or higher</font></li>
    <li>HLSL shader compiler <font color = "#FFFFFF">(D3DCompiler_43 or D3DCompiler_47)</font><br>(note that D3DCompiler_47 is part of Windows 10)</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
4. Test results
</u></font></h2>
<p>
We can examine this in two aspects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Used hardware and performance</b></font><br>
        I've tested and run different versions of dgVoodoo2 on the following GPU's:
        <font color = "#FFFFFF"><ul>
            <li>Intel HD 2000 (feature level 10.0 only)</li>
            <li>GeForce 8600 GT (feature level 10.0 only)</li>
            <li>Intel HD 4000</li>
            <li>Geforce GT 610</li>
            <li>AMD HD 6450</li>
            <li>Intel HD Graphics 530</li>
            <li>GeForce GTS 450</li>
            <li>AMD HD 7850</li>
            <li>GeForce GTX Ti560 (RIP)</li>
            <li>AMD R7 360</li>
            <li>GeForce GTX 1060</li>
        </ul></font>
        If dynamic shader compiling is utilized then dgVoodoo generally performs quite well on all hardware except
        integrated chips (like Intel HD 2000 and 4000).<br>
        Using only precompiled shaders requires a mid-class video card at least, and the low-end ones (intended for office-like usage) like
        Geforce GT 610 and AMD HD 6450 are not recommended.
    </li>

    <br><li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Accuracy of the emulation, individual games and applications</b></font><br>
        Of course it's not perfect but I think I got very nice results in general. I maintain expanding lists for games and demos, for DirectX emulation:<br>
        <a href="http://dege.fw.hu/Gallery/DXGamesGallery.html">Games</a><br>
        <a href="http://dege.fw.hu/Gallery/DXDemosGallery.html">Demos</a><br>
        </li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
5. Usage
</u></font></h2>
<p>
There is no installer for dgVoodoo beacuse you can copy its dlls anywhere
you want (to use). If u like it and want to use as the only global Glide
wrapper on your machine then copy Glide dlls to the system folder. Glide dlls
are available in both 32bit (x86) and 64bit (x64) versions. x64 version is for 64 bit <font color = "#FFFFFF">QEmu</font> (and maybe
64 bit <font color = "#FFFFFF">DosBox</font>) builds.
<font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>For native usage you always need the 32bit (x86) version dlls.</b></font>
<br>
For DirectX emulation only a local installation is possible since the
DirectX dlls CANNOT be copied to the system folder (see DirectX readme).
Also, D3D9 has both 32 and 64 bit versions. Always use the proper one, depending on the application type (not the OS type).
</p>
<p>
A Glide wrapped application can start up either in windowed or full screen
mode (it is controlled by the <font color = "#FFFFFF">Control Panel</font>, see later). Also, you can switch between
them during the gameplay by Alt-Enter. See 'Known issues' for more.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for wrapped DirectX applications, but it is a more
complicated case, see DirectX readme.
</p>
<p>
Glide and DirectX dlls can co-work inside a process so the same versions
of them have to be used within a folder. If one of them detects the other
with different version then it refuses to initialize and work.
Co-work is useful for applications that use DirectDraw for some initial
in-game menu and Glide for 3D rendering.
</p>
<p>
If you use dgVoodoo on Windows 10 then dynamic shader compiling is automatically
available because D3DCompiler_47 is part of the operating system.<br>
For preceding Windows versions (Vista, 7, 8) you need to download it manually and
then, you can copy this dll into each game folder next to the wrapper dlls but the
best practice is to copy it into
</p>

<ul>
<li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Windows\System32    folder for 32 bit operating systems</font></li>
<li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Windows\SysWOW64    folder for 64 bit operating systems</font></li>
</ul>

<p>
if it is not already there by the result of the installation of some
other software.<br>
Note that dgVoodoo supports both D3DCompiler_43 and D3DCompiler_47.
_43 is supported only because of compatibility with users having it
downloaded and copied into their system folder previously.
</p>
<p>
Utilizing dynamic shader compiling is only recommended for Glide libraries (unlike with previous dgVoodoo versions).
DirectX implementations have their own internal DXBC generator which proved to be good enough
so support for the external compiler has been removed.
(I would like to completely ditch the external compiler once the internal code generator is implemented for Glide as well.)
</p>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
6. Configuring
</u></font></h2>
<p>
As different options might wanted to be used for particular applications,
I kept the concept of local/global configurations (might be familiar from old dgVoodoo).
Current configuration is stored in a file named 'dgVoodoo.conf'. Its format can either be
binary or a textual INI-file for manual editing.
</p>
<p>
When the Glide or DirectX wrapped application starts, dgVoodoo tries to read
config data. The search paths and the order for the config file are the following:
<ul>
    <li>Folder of the wrapper DLL</li>
    <li>Folder of the application (EXE)</li>
    <li>User application data folder</li>
</ul>
If the config file can be found in none of them then the default config is used.
</p>
<p>
For modifying config files, you can either use <font color = "#FFFFFF">dgVoodoo Control Panel (dgVoodooCpl)</font> or edit it manually with a text editor.
dgVoodooCPL provides convenient GUI interface for all options but only the most important sections are available by default. You have to enable the advanced
options through the context menu. This is because of emphasizing the sufficiency of the default sections for the everyday usage and leaving the advanced
sections for practiced users knowing what they are doing.<br>
In dgVoodooCpl you can choose a folder where you can load (from) and save the current
configuration. Once you chose a folder, it remains in the list permanently.
If the CPL application finds a valid config file in its own folder (where the app itself
is located) then it automatically places the folder into the list and selects the folder.
Otherwise the user's application data folder is selected, by default.
</p>
<p>
Note that
    <ul>
        <li>CPL always writes INI format config file (unlike previous versions) - and you can edit it manually, passing over the CPL</li>
        <li>CPL doesn't expose all the sections of the configuration by default only the most important ones - you have to enable additional ones through the context menu</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
If an application tolerates losing focus without closing/minimizing itself,
you can configure it dynamically: when the CPL starts up it builds
a list of detected running Glide/DirectX wrapped applications and insert it
into the folder selector combobox. When you select such a running instance
then the current state of the application is read as config and most of the
options can also be changed. So, you can set resolution, msaa, brightness,
etc on the spot without restarting the application (configurable items depend
on emulation type). When an option changes, it takes effect at once. If the
dialog gets cancelled or an other config folder/instance is selected, all the
changes gets cancelled as well.
</p>
<p>
You can always use the <font color = "#FFFFFF">'Apply' button</font> to save the current config to the
selected folder or running application without exiting the CPL application.

Important to note:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
   If the wrapped app and the CPL runs on different privilege levels
   (admin/nonadmin) then the app won't appear in the instance list or they
   cannot communicate to each other. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
   Switching resolution or MSAA can only be performed perfectly if the
   application re-renders everything on each frame. If it uses or keeps
   previously (once-)rendered things like cockpits or similars then they will
   be missing as will not get re-rendered. (Glide only)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A folder inserted formerly into the list can be removed. Also, list of the
running instances can be refreshed.</p>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
7. Resolution and refresh rate overriding
</u></font></h2>

<p>
You can override the application resolution and refresh rate both for
Glide and DirectX rendering.<br>
There are three types of resolution overriding, and, the 'Resolution'
comboboxes contain two types of elements in the enumerated list:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <font color = "#FFFFFF">Static resolutions</font>
  <p>
  Those are enumerated by your videocard for the selected display output.
  Select any of them, and the wrapper will force that one (along with the selected refresh rate),
  no matter what resolution the application wants to set.<br>
  Resolution 'Unforced' means always using the current application resolution, so there is no overriding at all.
  </p>
</li>
<br>
<li>
  <font color = "#FFFFFF">Dynamic resolutions</font>
  <p>
  First, a little explanation on what the practical problems are with static
  resolutions (especially for DirectX applications).
  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>
    The application may use multiple resolutions for different parts like movies,
    menus and ingame. The statically chosen resolution may not have the same
    aspect ratio as those of them. For app-resolutions with different aspect
    ratios like 4:3 vs 16:9 it's a problem because one of them will be displayed
    hugely distorted.</p>

<li><p>
    Even if the app uses only one resolution, and you can select or type another
    one with the same aspect ratio, then selecting the proper resolution is still
    not an easy task:<br>
    a) you don't necessarily know what resolution the app uses<br>
    b) you don't necessarily know what the max resolution your display is capable
       of<br>
    c) even if you know both of them, you may have to calculate manually the
       desired resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  (My own problem was the following: I sat down in front of a new computer with
   a 4K monitor and wanted to try out some stuffs through dgVoodoo. I faced the
   fact that I didn't know the exact monitor resolution, I also didn't know what
   res the stuffs to try were using. I just wanted the maximum available
   resolution to be forced that keeps the aspect ratio.)
</p>
<p>
  Dynamic resolution is the synonim of "let the wrapper choose the current
  resolution for you". The maximum, and also the base used for calculating the
  current resolution, is your desktop resolution. The base rule is that the
  wrapper always calculates the maximum available resolution for the given
  scaling mode, but
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>you can restrict the base maximum to <font color = "#FFFFFF">FullHD (1920x1080) or QHD (2560x1440)</font>
        for weaker GPUs (like low-end cards or maybe, integrated chips) with large-res display outputs, and</p></li>
    <li><p>you can restrict the scale factor to integer numbers.<br>
        <font color = "#FFFFFF">(ISF - integer scale factor)</font></p></li>
</ul>

  So, dynamic resolutions are the following:
<ul>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">2x, 3x, ...:</font>    Integer multiples of application resolutions; doubled, tripled, etc.</li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max:</font>           Maximum resolution available</li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max ISF:</font>       Maximum resolution with integer scale factor available</li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max FHD:</font>       Maximum resolution available
                      (but restricted to 1920x1080)</li>
  <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max FHD ISF:</font>     Maximum resolution with integer scale factor available
                      (but restricted to 1920x1080)</li>
  <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max QHD:</font>         Maximum resolution available
                      (but restricted to 2560x1440)</li>
  <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max QHD ISF:</font>     Maximum resolution with integer scale factor available
                      (but restricted to 2560x1440)</li>
</ul>
<p>
When working with a dynamic resolution, the concrete resolution is unknown (calculated at runtime) hence no refresh rates are enumerated along with them,
even if enumerating refresh rates is enabled.
You can still force one (see Custom resolutions below).<br>
See the API specific readmes to understand the logic of selecting a real refresh rate value for unforced cases.
</p>

<li>
  <font color = "#FFFFFF">Custom resolutions</font>
  <p>
  A custom resolution is either a static one that is not in the enumerated list, or one that is partially overridden.
  Defining a custom resolution through the CPL is about typing the string -manually into the combo box- describing the resolution/refresh rate pair.<br>
  Resolution and refresh rate can be overridden independently on each other. Here are some examples (don't type quotation marks):
  <ul>
    <li>"128x128, 60" - means static resolution 128x128 at forced rate of 60Hz</li>
    <li>"128x128, 0" or just "128x128" - means static resolution 128x128 without overridden refresh rate</li>
    <li>"0x0, 75" or "unforced, 75" - means unforced (static) resolution with forced 75Hz</li>
    <li>"max isf, 83" - means Max ISF dynamic resolution with forced 83Hz</li>
  </ul><br>
  If your resolution and refresh rate is in the list then it is better to select it from there than typing it manually.
  It is because e.g. 60Hz is not exactly 60Hz in practice but 60.01Hz or 59.95Hz or so, depending on your display hardware.
  dgVoodoo always handles the refresh rates in their exact rational form but it cannot do that with manually typed ones.<br>
  When displaying a refresh rate in the combo box, dgVoodoo truncates the value. So, for example, 59.95Hz will appear as 59Hz
  in the list, while the display manufacturer probably claims that your display supports 60Hz. Don't let it mislead you. It is all
  about truncating or rounding the values.
  </p>
</li>

</ul>

If you are terribly interested in how the current dynamic resolution is calculated then
a little technical part comes here. Otherwise you can skip this section.

<br>
Remarks:
<ul>
    <li><p>
        Resolution is calculated in the same way for scaling mode 'Unspecified', 'Centered' and 'Stretch with AR'.<br>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Stretched scaling mode with ISF tries to stretch to min([D|F|Q]) and the
        scale factor for both direction is the integer part of the minimum of<br>
        <font color = "#FFFFFF">min ([Dx|Fx|Qx])/Ax</font> and <font color = "#FFFFFF">min ([Dy|Fy|Qy])/Ay</font>
        (ratios of X/Y directions).
    </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I'd like to say some words about what happens on multimonitor systems with
dynamic resolution forcing:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
        Glide: when switching from windowed mode to fullscreen then a new forced
               resolution is calculated by the wrapper, based on the native res of the
               display on which the full screen output will appear.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        DX:    It's not so flexible at all, unfortunately. Since DX impl doesn't
               support changing resolution during its working, it cannot do the same
               as Glide when switching into fullscreen. Also, since display outputs
               are enumerated to the application, resolution calculation can rely only
               on the native res of the output on which DX is initialized (so changing
               the output of a running DX emulated app from the CPL application is without avail,
               won't affect the next resolution calculation).
     </p></li>
</ul>

    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Progressive scanline order</b></font><br>
                        Default scanline order is interlaced or progressive. It is
                        up to the output display device which one to choose altough
                        it chooses progressive when it is possible, I think, so
                        that when the device is capable of displaying a given
                        resolution with a given refresh rate with progressive order.
                        Otherwise it might choose interlaced order with halved
                        physical refresh rate.
                        If this option is enabled, you can only see enumerated
                        resolutions that are displayable with progressive order.
                        However, if a custom resolution is defined then it may
                        causes the output device to use lower physical resolution
                        than the wrapper set.

                        default refresh rate of the application.
                        <font color = "#FFFFFF">However using other than the app default can cause heavy

    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Color adjustments</b></font><br>
                        Brightness, color intensity (saturation) and contrast can be finetuned here.
                        The defaults are good in general so treat this as a
                        cool extra. (I'm using it in some cases for making colors

                        just like in windowed mode and so your pre-configured color profile(s)
                        for the given monitor(s) remain(s) preserved. Color adjustments are
                        relative to the predefined color profile in that case.

    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Capture mouse</b></font><br>
                        It's useful mainly (but not only) for multimonitor systems. If this is enabled then the mouse cursor

    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Center app window</b></font><br>
                        When a game controlling the mouse input is being run in windowed mode then
                        it's a pain to move it's window into the screen, so I thought it's a valuable option (was a request too),
                        but it can conflict with the mouse input or the app itself.

9. General additional options
</u></font></h2>

<ul>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>DesktopResolution</b></font>
    <p>dgVoodoo takes the current desktop resolution as a base to do its calculations for self-done output scaling and other things like automatic pixel multiplying factor value.
       There some games however that pre-set the desktop resolution (typically to some low resolution) before dgVoodoo gets in action, spoiling the rendering.
       You can define your native desktop resolution here for such cases. If defined then this resolution is used for all outputs of the desktop.
    </p></li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>DesktopBitDepth</b></font>
    <p>You can define what screen bit depth should be reported through dgVoodoo. It can be 8, 16 or 32. Empty definition means the current system desktop bit depth.
    </p></li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>DeframerSize</b></font>
    <p>When resolution is forced to other than the app default then a black frame is drawn around the output image coming from a wrapped API to remove scaling artifacts -
       frame thickness can be defined in pixels (max 16, 0 = disable) (default is 1).
    </p></li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>ImageScaleFactor</b></font>
    <p>Integer factor for scaling the output image coming from a wrapped API (pixel multiplying). This is independent on scaling mode.
       0 = maximum available factor. Default is 1 (no multiplying). Separate factors can be defined for horizontal and vertical directions.
    </p></li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>DisplayROI</b></font>
    <p>Display region of interest: you can define a subrectangle in forced resolution space (or application resolution if it is unforced) to be the input of the scaling and
        image presenting process. It works only for scaling modes where the image processing is done by dgVoodoo itself. Subrectangle can either be
        <ul>
        <li>defined as a proportion in form of <b>%d_%d</b>, like 16_9 or 16_10, etc.</li>
        <li>or defined as a pixel size in form of <b>%d|%d</b>, like 320|200 or 640|400, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Pos subproperty defines the top-left position of the rectangle. It can be 
        <ul>
            <li><b>centered</b><font color="#FFFFFF"> (default)</font></li>
            <li>a pixel position in form of <b>%d|%d</b>, like 100|100</li>
        </ul>
    </p></li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Resampling</b></font>
    <p>When the scaling is done by the wrapper for the given scaling mode, you can choose which type of resampling filter to use.
        Those are the following, in the order of complexity:
        <ul>
            <li>Point sampled: the simplest and fastest but providing pixelated result</li>
            <li>Bilinear: Smooth but blurred result</li>
            <li>Lanczos-2: Smooth but more sharper result - it can produce slight halation around sharp edges</li>
            <li>Bicubic: Smooth but more sharper result</li>
            <li>Lanczos-2: Smooth and sharpest result - it can produce stronger halation than Lanczos-2</li>
        </ul>
    </p></li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>FreeMouse</b></font>
    <p>When enabled, physical mouse is free to move inside the game window when using emulated scaling and/or application and forced resolution differs;
       can be useful when a game relies on the physical window size.
    </p></li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>WindowedAttributes</b></font>
    <p>You can force various properties for windowed mode rendering. The following properties can be listed, separated by commas
		<ul>
		<li><b>Borderless:</b> forces borderless window</li>
		<li><b>AlwaysOnTop:</b> forces the window into the topmost z-order band</li>
        <li><b>FullscreenSize:</b> the window content is the same as in fullscreen mode including the potential side black bars, depending on the scaling mode</li>
		</ul>
		<BR>
        You can more or less emulate fake fullscreen with defining Borderless and FullscreenSize together along with enabling centered window.
    </p></li>
	<li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Environment</b></font>
    <p>Defines the software environment in which dgVoodoo is running. Its value can be
		<ul>
		<li>empty <font color = "#FFFFFF">(default)</font></li>
		<li><b>DosBox</b> to force DosBox environment</li>
		<li><b>QEmu</b></li>
		</ul>
		<BR>
		Unless you use dgVoodoo in QEmu it's recommended to leave its value empty because dgVoodoo can detect DosBox automatically.<br>
		In QEmu environment dgVoodoo disables its own handling of the rendering window including Alt-Enter for manual screen mode switching.
    </p></li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>EnableGDIHooking</b></font>
    <p>Very experimental option - when enabled dgVoodoo hooks some GDI functions to achieve displaying game cutscene movies rendered
       through GDI (relying typically on the old AVI player lib)
    </p></li>

10. Direct3D 12
</u></font></h2>

Why D3D12? Because I wanted to code something using D3D12 and rotating cubes are boring.
However, it has some drawbacks in dgVoodoo compared to D3D11.<br>
Here are some facts and tips in regard of D3D12:

<ul>
    <li>dgVoodoo D3D11 is broken with AMD GPU's (DirectX modules). I got a ton of reports complaining about
        solid colored polygons instead of textured ones. This problem seems to affect all
        GCN 2 and newer GPU's and I cannot do anything about fixing it. I don't have a clue what change in my code
        broke it and AMD probably won't fix their drivers so I don't care about it all anymore.<br>
        On the other hand, according to the feedback I got, D3D12 works as expected so this is your
        best bet on AMD hardware.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Windows (not the OS but GUI windows) backed by swapchains with FLIP_DISCARD presenting mode, which is
        mandatory for D3D12,  cannot transition back to "legacy" (GDI) presentation mode. Unfortunately it means
        that D3D12 can be completely unusable for applications that render into their windows through multiple API's
        like GDI, D3D9, etc. and D3D12 (dgVoodoo). Such an application is DosBox. I don't recommend dgVoodoo D3D12 for that,
        unless you play a Glide game that has no VGA-rendered parts.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Unlike D3D11 swapchains in dgVoodoo, D3D12 swapchains (FLIP_DISCARD) always render into a window,
        even in fullscreen mode. Some games resize their window to match the resolution they think they rendering at.
        No matter if you run the game in fullscreen mode, this causes a small window in the top-left corner of the
        desktop if it happens. Try disabling option <font color="#FFFFFF">'Disable Alt-Enter to toggle screen state'</font> (see DirectX options)
        in such a case. It may help because dgVoodoo window hooking runs on a different path in that case and it forces
        back the window size to cover the entire screen.
</li>
    <br>
    <li>Implied by the previous point, D3D12 swapchains do not support gamma ramps as well. dgVoodoo can apply gamma
        as a postprocess effect but I didn't want it to be always forced to have effect (to get max fps's for games
        that don't really need gamma calibration) so it only works if option <font color="#FFFFFF">'Inherit Color Profile in full screen mode'</font>
    is enabled (see General options).
</li>
    <br>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">MSI Afterburner</font> relies on D3D11on12 to render its own overlay when hooking D3D12.
        I ran into multiple cases when D3D11on12 crashed or hung at startup, for unknown reasons.
        First try a game with MSIA shut down if you have problem with launching it.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>If you have multiple displays attached to different GPU's (rare case) then you can run into an
        unexplainable initialization fail with certain games. D3D12 swapchains suffer from more restrictions than
        D3D11 ones which the current version of dgVoodoo cannot handle well. Enable only one of your video cards
        (see General options) and it should fix the problem.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Because of the problems listed above and other known D3D12 issues that I want to address in subsequent releases, <font color="#FFFFFF">Output API option 'Best available'</font>
        never chooses D3D12 automatically. If you want D3D12 then you must choose it explicitly in the config.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>A last one: unlike in D3D11, feature levels cannot be forced in D3D12. D3D12 takes the minimum feature level as
        an input parameter but initializes itself at the highest available one (which is greater than or equal to the mininum).
        So, if your GPU supports FL12.0 then it's all for the same which feature level you choose in the config.</li>
</ul>

<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
11. General tips and known issues
</u></font></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Forcing things (like resolution, antialiasing, texture filtering, etc) is
       not a healthy thing. If an application or game uses low resolution or point
       sampled textures or anything dissonant to the eye then it has reasons for
       that. It is not because the programmers were so lame but of avoiding artifacts
       that would otherwise get brought in (typical example is a bilinear filtered
       texture with colorkey based transparency). If you force anything then
       potentially get one of those artifacts. If you can live with it then it is ok,
       use the wrapper in forced mode. If not then disable all forcings and use the
       particular game or application in the mode it was designed for, because no
       general method exists to fix such type of artifacts.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Controlling antialiasing cannot be done on per-primitive basis in Direct3D 11
       when feature set larger than 10.0 is used. That is why antialiased drawing
       is not emulated in Glide automatically in this version in any way (per-primitive or
       per-edge). It can only be forced globally in the CPL application.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fullscreen gamma ramp may not be supported by your card. nVidia and ATI seem
        to handle it as expected but (e.g.) Intel does not.</li>
    <br>
    <li>When an application is being run in compatibility mode (Win98/XP etc) then
       <font color = "#FFFFFF">the user's application data folder is different than the OS default.</font>
       Therefore dgVoodoo cannot read the global config file and the default
       config gets applied if no local config file is present. The preferred way
       is creating a local config for such cases if other than the default needed.
       (Perhaps using the user's appdata folder is not a too good idea after all,
       I might change it later.)</li>
    <br>
    <li>If you have a multimonitor system then always try a game to run on the primary
        one for the first time. Some games lock the mouse cursor to the screen area
        where game window is assumed to be (the left-top corner of the desktop).
        If such a game is being forced onto another monitor then clicking in the game
        causes application focus loss because its window is not under the mouse cursor.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I don't know why but overriding refresh rates by arbitrary values (in the resolution selector combo box) does not
        seem to work for DirectX emulation. It is still subject to investigation because the code
        handling this is common for both Glide and DirectX. :(

<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
12. Special release version with debug layer
</u></font></h2>

Special release version of dgVoodoo contains an additional validator and report layer. Its purpose is

<ul>
    <li>1) giving feedback to the user about potential error conditions, what currently is happening, and, how dgVoodoo is driven by the application at all</li>
    <li>2) helping debugging a given application/game by the (extensive) feedback and opening the possibility to break into the debugger</li>
</ul>

dgVoodoo currently has 2 main types for debug feedback

<ul>
    <li><b>Simple messages with 3 subtypes which can be disabled or associated with a debugger break</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li><font color="#FFFFFF">INFO</font>: harmless message about various events like creating/releasing an API object, reading a config file, loading a module, etc.</li>
        <li><font color="#FFFFFF">WARNING</font>: a message about a potential error condition</li>
        <li><font color="#FFFFFF">ERROR</font>: a message about an API driving error or an internal error of dgVoodoo. The latter is fatal, while the prior one may be normal.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><b>Tracing</b> - means the full logging of API calls made to dgVoodoo and some additional information of dgVoodoo internals.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><font color="#FFFFFF">Level 0</font>: Tracing disabled</li>
        <li><font color="#FFFFFF">Level 1</font>: Logging of API calls</li>
        <li><font color="#FFFFFF">Level 2</font>: Logging of API calls + some additional info</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Messages and tracing are independent on each other. Tracing is mainly for devs, for quick and average usage only the messages are recommended.<br>
All of them are written to the debug output, logging to file is not yet implemented.<br>
<br>
So, I recommend you to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview">DebugView</a> or much more <a href="https://github.com/CobaltFusion/DebugViewPP/releases">DebugView++</a>.
They are very cool applications for cases when no any debugger is available. Also, if you have more than one monitors then you can watch the log in realtime: put DebugView++ on one display and run the game on another.
</p>

<p>
Messages have a <font color="#FFFFFF">'[dgVoodoo]'</font> prefix so the best way to check out a game with dgVoodoo's debug layer is enabling filtering to the 'dgVoodoo' substring (Crtl-L in DebugView and F5 in DebugView++).
Every single log output appear in new lines in DebugView/DebugView++ - this is nice, except for some tracing messages written to the output part by part, like D3D8 disassembled shaders.
Unfortunately they appear nastily because of that.
</p>

<p>
It's not really a big problem however because I cannot recommend you to enable tracing. It's much more intended for developers but if you want to use it after all then
do it with <font color="#FFFFFF">DebugView++</font> or a debugger like <font color="#FFFFFF">Visual Studio 2015</font> because feedback is so tremendous that only tools 
with asynchronous debug output window are able to handle it. Tools with synchronous debug output like <font color="#FFFFFF">DebugView</font> won't be able to keep up with
it and make your game/app crawl at speed near zero.
</p>

<p>I must emphasize:
    <ul>
    <li>Do not look for a miracle when using the debug layer! If some game doesn't work for you then it can give you some useful feedback
        on what's going on, or you can see if dgVoodoo is utilized at all but won't necessarily tell you why the game crashes, for example.<br>
        Also, if you see an ERROR entry in the log then it doesn't necessarily mean you did something wrong or there is a problem with your game.
        Many games rely on error codes got back from an API. So, for example if you see such a log like the following snippet
        <PRE class=code>
...
[15500] [dgVoodoo] INFO: Direct3DDevice (0D3967D8)::EnumTextureFormats: Format XRGB8888 is enumerated to the application.
[15500] [dgVoodoo] INFO: Direct3DDevice (0D3967D8)::EnumTextureFormats: Format ARGB8888 is enumerated to the application.
[15500] [dgVoodoo] INFO: Direct3DDevice (0D3967D8) is released.
[15500] [dgVoodoo] ERROR: DirectDrawSurface (0D2380C8)::DeleteAttachedSurface: Failed, HRESULT: DDERR_SURFACENOTATTACHED
[15500] [dgVoodoo] INFO: DirectDrawSurface (0D2380C8) Plain offscreen rendertarget is released.
[15500] [dgVoodoo] INFO: Direct3D (0ABC87B0)::EnumDevices: Device enumerated, Name: "Direct3D HAL", Description: "dgVoodoo Hardware A...
...
        </PRE>
        Then the error entry about failed 'DeleteAttachedSurface' is not really an error. The application tried to delete a potential attached z-buffer, just to make sure, and doesn't care about the result.
        dgVoodoo however treat it as an error because it caused an error in an API method. It's really impossible to make a decision about classifying some conditions as an error or just a plain warning.<br>
        But let's look at another case: one of my game just crashes right at startup. What could be the reason? The debug output is:
        <PRE class=code>
...
[21964] [dgVoodoo] INFO: Direct3D8 (077BCEC8) Virtual video card is 'dgVoodoo Virtual 3D Accelerated' with 64MB onboard memory.
[21964] [dgVoodoo] ERROR: Direct3D8 (077BCEC8): Validation of D3D8 swapchain presentation parameters failed.
                          Reason: display mode "800x600, 72Hz" is required but not supported by output device: 0, DeviceType: D3DDEVT...
[21964] [dgVoodoo] ERROR: Direct3DDevice8 (0EE99530)::Init: Cannot create device implicit swapchain.
[21964] [dgVoodoo] ERROR: Direct3D8 (077BCEC8)::CreateDevice: Initializing Direct3DDevice8 (0EE99530) failed.
...
        </PRE>
        Ah, OK. Previously I configured the game to run on a display at 72Hz but now I'm trying to run it on another that does not support this refresh rate at this resolution,
        so D3D8 initialization failed in dgVoodoo and so the game crashed due to lack of error checking.
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Use the spec release only for trying to solve an extant problem with an applicaiton. Spec release does some extra checking and validation compared to normal dgVoodoo releases and it can bite off from the speed or cause stuttering.
    </li>
</ul></p>

                control panel and select 'unspecified' mode in dgVoodoo Setup.
                If it does not work then your only chance is forcing it through the
                graphics control panel (it all seems to be a Windows issue).</li>
            <li>Disabling 'Bilinear blit stretch' in the default configuration.
                I've seen a few games where it caused more 'harm' than coolness that is

                    blitting to/from textures, Z-buffers and 3D-renderable surfaces with
                    several pixel formats. Also, general API-behavioring is more accurate
                    to the original one because of lot of bugfixings and heavy reverse
                    engineering.</li>

                version 1.0.0.4), however I did not include them in the core dgVoodoo
